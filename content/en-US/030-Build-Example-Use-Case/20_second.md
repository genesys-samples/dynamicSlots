## Building the Genesys Bot Flow
A Genesys Bot Flow is necessary to accomplish our use case of disputing a transaction. The reason that we need a bot flow is so we can communicate back and forth with the customer via an NLU engine about which transaction they believe is fraudulent. Follow these steps to create your bot flow. There is also a video that you can watch of these steps at the end of this section if you prefer that. 

### Creating a Bot Flow

1. Navigate to Genesys Cloud CX Architect and choose Bot Flows from the flows drop down
![Bot Flow](/images/botFlow.jpg)
    - note: if you don't see this, be sure that Genesys Bot Flows are enabled in your org and that you have permissions to view and edit them.
2. Click to create a new bot flow. Give it a descriptive name, and under Template choose Blank Bot Flow
![Create Bot Flow](/images/createBotFlow.jpg)

### Calling the Data Action
1. The first thing we need to do in the bot flow is to drag a Call Data Action block as the start of our flow. 
2. For Category, choose the Web Services Data Actions integration that you set up earlier
3. Under Data Action, choose the data action that we imported earlier 
4. Create variables for both the Success Outputs of transactions.Store and transactions.Value

Now your flow should look like this:

### Setting up the Dynamic List Slot Variable
1. Inside of the bot flow, on the left side, navigate to Slot Types. Click to add a new slot type
2. Give it a descriptive name, such as Transaction List, and then choose Dynamic List as the slot type
![Dynamic List](/images/dynamicList.jpg)
3. Now navigate to Bot Flow Settings
![Bot Flow Settings](/images/botFlowSettings.jpg)
4. In the Bot Flow Settings, under Dynamic Slot Types, add the variable that you created for the stores under the values column.
    - In theory, you could also choose the transaction amount as the variable. In a real world scenario, you'd probably want each transaction to have a unique ID in case of duplicate transactions.
    - We won't have any synonyms in our example

5. Now navigate to the Slots button under Natural Language Understanding. Click to add a new slot. Give it a descriptive name and choose Existing as the Associated Slot Type. Choose the dynamic list slot type that we just created.

### Building the Rest of the Bot Flow
Now we need to make this transaction dispute conversational. We already have the data that we need from our data action and our slot's are all set up. Let's use that to guide our conversation.
1. First, we need to read off the transactions to the customer. To do this, drag a Communicate block under the Success path of the data action. Once you've added this click to configure communication on the right.
![Configure Communication](/images/configureCommunication.jpg)
2. In the Communication Sequence Builder, add some text that says:
```We are sorry that you feel there has been fraudulent activity on your account. We will read off your most recent transactions and you can tell us which one is fraudulent.```
![Add Text](/images/addText.jpg)
3. Now we need to loop through the array of transaction stores and amounts and read them off. To do this, add a Loop Block under that Communicate block. Be sure to give the loop index a variable name and set the Max Loop Count to a variable that counts the number of items in your Transactions.store variable array. This expression will mean the loop will only happen for the amount of stores we have pulled back in that array.
    - The Count function will look at the number of values in our array and return the aggregated total number of items in the array. For example, we will have 3 transactions in our array; thus, the Count function will return a value of 3.

> **The expression will look like - Count(add your variable name here)**

![Loop](/images/loop.jpg)
4. Now drag another Communicate block inside of the loop and click to configure Communication.
![loop Communicate](/images/loopCommunicate.jpg)
5. Now we need to have an expression that uses our loop to get the transaction stores and amounts in the array and read them off in sequential order. In the Communication Sequence Builder, toggle to Expression and paste in this expression: 

![Expression](/images/expression.jpg)

##### **In the code snip below, make sure the flow variables match what you named your variables, including case sensitivity!!!**

```
MakeCommunication(
  "$", 
  ToCommunication(GetAt(Flow.transactionValues, Flow.loopIndex)), 
  "at ", 
  ToCommunication(GetAt(Flow.transactionStores, Flow.loopIndex)))
```
  - The GetAt function finds a value in an array based upon it's numeric position. In our scenario, we are looking for both the transaction values and the transaction stores and finding those values based upon the numeric position that corresponds with the loop count. The table below gives a visual into our function above. We are using the loop count to find the numeric position and then return the transaction value and the transaction store at that numeric position.
  - Here is an example of what would be returned with this expression based on the table below: "$ 100 at Walmart". Then the second loop would read "$ 150 at Menards" and so forth.
  - Take a second to review the expression to be sure that this makes sense to you

  |Loop Count | Numeric Position | Transaction Value | Transaction store |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  |0 | 0 | 100 | Walmart|
  |1 | 1 | 150 | Menards |
  |2 | 2| 200 | DSW |



6. Now we can ask the customer to tell us which store they'd like to dispute the transaction with. To do this drag an Ask for Slot block under the Communicate block, but out of the loop. On the right, select the slot that we created earlier. For the question say:
``` Which store do you want to dispute the transaction with?```
![Ask for Slot](/images/askForSlot.jpg)
7. Lastly, let's enable Automatic Quick-Reply Buttons for our bot. Navigate to User Input under Settings on the left hand side, and then ensure that Automatic Quick-Reply Buttons is set to On.
![Quick Replies](/images/quickReplies.jpg)
8. Now just click publish and you are ready to move on to the next section! 

It's important to know that this bot flow that we built is not typical in the fact that we never had an Ask for Intent block. In our scenario, we are pretending like we've already identified that every person who gets in contact with this bot needs to dispute a transaction.
